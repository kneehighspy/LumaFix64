# LumaFix64
The LumaFix64 is not my design. It is based on <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=40570&start=375">e5frog's LumaFix64 design</a>, which was released in March 7th, 2018 in the Lemon64.com forum. The changes in my design are:
* No through hole parts
* PCB a little bit narrower
* the Chroma potentiometer (CHR) can be replaced with a fix resistor or just a solder bridge

The Chroma potentiometer is IMHO not required, because it is not desirable to reduce the chominance level before the composite video signal is generated in the RF modulator. 

The LumaFix64 requires the precision round pin strips, because those are narrow enough not to break the socket of VIC-II chip. Since these pin strips are fragile, the LumaFix64 has to be handle with care.

I have received the permission of e5frog for publishing these files in this github repository (see screen shot in the "pictures" folder).

# BOM value
The calculation of the BOM values is available in the EXCEL folder. The total BOM value is 9,63â‚¬ (May 2020). This includes the Chroma pot and domestic pin strips. It is possible to save money on both, when ordering overseas.
